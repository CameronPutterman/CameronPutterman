Hi, Iâ€™m Cameron Putterman and I'm a data analyst working in consulting. 
I am expanding my skills through advanced coursework in data-driven programming languages to deepen my expertise and add value in a data-focused role. This site is my Instagram for all the data learning I am working through.
