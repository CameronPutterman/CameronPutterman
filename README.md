Hi, Iâ€™m Cameron Putterman.
I am an aspiring data analyst.
I have a background in client facing roles and I am actively expanding my skills through advanced coursework in data-driven programming languages to deepen my expertise and add value in a data-focused role. This site is my Instagram for all the data learning I am working through.
